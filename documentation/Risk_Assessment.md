### Risk Identification and Analysis
| Risk                             |  Type                 |  Probability  |  Severity     |  Result  |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| Client Scope Creep               |  Requirements         |  Moderate     |  Tolerable    |  10      |
| Team Scope Creep                 |  Requirements         |  Low          |  Severe       |  10      |
| System Integration Difficulty    |  Technology           |  Low          |  Catastrophic |  15      |
| Batch Job Integration Difficulty |  Technology           |  Moderate     |  Severe       |  20      |
| Environment Access               |  Organizational/Tools |  Low          |  Catastrophic |  15      |
| Personnel Unavailability         |  People               |  Low          |  Severe       |  10      |
| Underestimation                  |  Estimation           |  High         |  Severe       |  30      |
