1. Plan introduction and overview.  
	1.01 Purpose, scope, and objectives.  
	The purpose of this plan is to produce a step by step process to produce the product described in the System Architecture Document. The scope is limited as outlined in the Project Requirements Document. Objective is to successfully complete the deliverables on time.  
	1.02 Assumptions and constraints.  
	We assume that we will have access to a useful test environment as needed. We also assume that integration will be successful using tools we have previously cleared with the client. Primary constraint is access to a development server.  
3. Referenced documents.  
See System Architecture Document and Project Requirements Document.  
4. Identification of all software and software products to which the SDP applies.  
Node.js, Express, Twitter Bootstrap, Mocha.  
5. Definition of terms and acronyms.  
  
6. System overview, including system and software architecture.  
See the Software Architecture Document.  
7. Overview of required work, including:  
	7.01 Requirements and constraints on the system and software to be developed.  
	Requirements: pre-existing database server that is collecting data from the solar panels, host web server adequate to run Node.js, pre-existing website. Constraints: do not use Ruby. Or Angular.  
	7.02 Software products and related deliverables.  
	Functioning Node.js application, SQL scripts to expand and cache existing database, web page front end.
	7.03 Requirements and constraints on project documentation.  
	Project Requirements document, Project User Story document, Software Architecture Document, this Software Development Plan, and a Software Test Plan. Only constraints are team and client approval as appropriate.  
	7.04 Known software-specific risks.  
	None.  
8. Plans for performing general software development activities, including:  
	User story will be broken down into consumable work items, assignment of work items to team members. Team members will update each other on progress via Google Hangouts calls and chat messages, comments, and documentation, with the intention of ensuring that alternate team members are aware of progress. When the program is running and database updates are in place, the Testing Plan will include scenario tests from user stories. The program will be considered deliverable when it successfully fulfills all scenario requirements.  
9. Supporting processes and information, including:  
	9.01 Software risk management.  
	Risk Assessment will be reviewed each week until project completion.  
	9.02 Approach to requirements traceability.  
	Intention is for documentation to be adequate for someone unfamiliar with the original development project to maintain the code as necessary. Final System presentation and demo will be provided for client.
