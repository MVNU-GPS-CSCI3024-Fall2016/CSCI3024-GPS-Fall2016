1. Plan introduction and overview.
	1.01 Purpose, scope, and objectives.
	The purpose of this plan is to produce a step by step process to produce the product described in the System Architecture Document. The scope
	is limited as outlined in the Project Requirements Document. Objective is to successfully complete the deliverables on time.
	1.02 Assumptions and constraints.
	We assume that we will have access to a useful test environment as needed. We also assume that integration will be successful using tools
	we have previously cleared with the client. Primary constraint is access to a development server.
3. Referenced documents.
See System Architecture Document and Project Requirements Document.
4. Identification of all software and software products to which the SDP applies.
Node.js, Express, Twitter Bootstrap, Mocha.
